forwarding table: [dstAddr, port]
    -> mapping from dstAddr to the port for routing (many to one) 
dijkstra algorithm: works upon addr
    -> get the next router's addr
    -> transform neighbor's addr to port
    -> mapping from neighbor's addr to the corresponding port (one to one)
link states: dict of dict
    -> first level mapping: mapping from router's addr to its link states
    -> second level mapping: mapping from the neighbor's addr of the router to cost
seq_ns: [rtrAddr, seq_no]
    -> mapping from rtrAddr to the corresponding sequence number
incr_num: record its sequence number
